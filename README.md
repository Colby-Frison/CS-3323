## Directory Structure

### 1. `Homework/`
All homework assignments, solutions, and related files for the course.
- Some of the homework is questions from the textbook, others are projects assigned by the professor
  - Homework 2 - 4, and 8 are from the textbook
  - 5 is a racket project
  - 6 and 7 are python projects

### 2. `Notes/`
Mainly just notes from the lectures, some is expanded on using outside sources or AI, but most of it stems from the lecture material.

### 3. `Quizzes/`
For a select few quizzes we were allowed to use an IDE when writing the code, so some fo this is that. I think Quiz 9 may have some review, but I'm not sure.

### 4. `Final review/`
Materials for the final exam, including old quizzes, review notes, and summary sheets.

### 5. `Programming Language Pragmatics 4th Edition.pdf`

## General Outline

This repo is a collection of everything I did for CS-3323. It includes:

## Additional Notes

- Please don’t just copy or submit my work as your own. Use this as a reference to help you understand the material from the class.
  - Racket is a massive pain sometimes, so it can be useful to see an example of it
- If you’re looking for more resources, the textbook is decent, and there are a few good youtube videos. The topics covered are pretty niche though, so theres not to many useful resources.
